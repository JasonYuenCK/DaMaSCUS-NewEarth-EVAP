DaMaSCUS-SUN-EVAP
Dark Matter Simulation Code for the Sun, with capture- and evaporation-focused
extensions, now supporting runtime body-dependent radial grids for Earth-based
studies.

Overview
DaMaSCUS-SUN-EVAP builds on
DaMaSCUS-SUN and keeps its central
Monte Carlo picture: dark matter particles are propagated through the solar
potential, scatter on solar targets, and are classified from their trajectory
history. This branch is organized around production workflows for low-mass dark
matter capture and evaporation studies rather than broad direct-detection scans.

The current code path is centered on two practical modes:

Capture mode: a fast capture-rate workflow. It terminates a trajectory once
a post-scatter bound state is identified and avoids the full evaporation and
histogram output path.

Parameter-point simulation: the main evaporation workflow for one mass and
cross section. It accumulates time-weighted radial histograms, records complete
valid evaporation events, and can emit wall-clock snapshot progress files for
long MPI runs.

The older parameter-scan machinery is still present, but the most actively
maintained outputs in this branch are the capture summary and the single
parameter-point evaporation products.

Runtime Body-Dependent Radial Grid Refactor
The simulation code has been fully refactored from a fixed Sun-centered radial
grid to a runtime, body-dependent radial grid. The same trajectory, bincount,
Kepler exterior arc, snapshot, heartbeat, merge, MPI, final output, and
diagnostic pipeline now works for both Sun and Earth without hard-coded solar
constants. All major numerical stability issues, including the RK45 timeout
pathology, have been resolved.

The fixed constants R_SUN_KM, NUM_BINS, TOTAL_BINS, and BIN_WIDTH_KM
were replaced by a runtime Bincount_Radial_Grid that builds body-specific
inner and exterior bins from the target body radius, with Earth runs using a
0.001 R_body inner bin width, while the legacy Sun API is preserved for
backward compatibility. Trajectory histograms changed from fixed arrays to
runtime-sized vectors, and Hermite bincount deposition as well as Kepler
exterior arc accumulation now use the passed-in runtime grid instead of fixed
Sun constants. Trajectory_Simulator now holds a runtime radial grid and
provides an explicit-grid constructor, with the same grid shared across
bincount deposition, Kepler exterior arcs, and trajectory histogram allocation.

Snapshot binary checkpoints, shared state, report state, merge, and heartbeat
all support runtime histogram lengths and runtime radial grids, and snapshot
reports now output body-neutral metadata using r_lower_Rbody and
r_upper_Rbody. Aggregate histograms, jackknife storage and indexing, MPI
reductions, bincount.txt, residence_jackknife_blocks.tsv, and
run_metadata.json all use runtime bin counts and Rbody-normalized schema.

All diagnostic outputs migrated from Rsun to Rbody normalization, including
evaporation output, snapshot evaporation output, trajectory summary, trajectory
events, and invalid trajectory ledger, with output versions and binary
checkpoint versions incremented to avoid misreading old Rsun-normalized data.

Several numerical stability issues were fixed: the radial free-flight center
crossing now correctly flips r, v_radial, and axis_x instead of clamping
to zero; the Kepler exterior radial-grid edge classification near 1.1 R_body
was corrected; an unbound outward-escape fallback ensures unbound, outward,
scatter-free trajectories terminate correctly; and free-propagation timeout
diagnostics were added for state inspection at timeout. The high-cross-section
RK45 timeout pathology has also been resolved, with the root causes being the
radial center-crossing clamp and the missing unbound outward-escape termination,
so large timeout warning counts no longer appear in high-cross-section scans.
Dense-position tolerance metadata was corrected with a runtime overload
returning 2.0e-3 * radial_grid.Inner_Bin_Width_Km(), so Earth output now
reports the Earth-scaled tolerance.

The full test suite passed at 100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 17,
with focused trajectory tests at 37/37 passed, covering snapshot, runtime
Earth radial grid, data generation, MPI, trajectory, physics validation, solar
model, and build/config tests. The simulation code refactor is complete: the
pipeline is fully runtime body-dependent, numerically stable, and validated by
the full test suite.

Main Changes
Compared with the upstream DaMaSCUS-SUN workflow, this branch emphasizes:

runtime, body-dependent radial grids instead of fixed solar constants;

in-memory radial bincount accumulation instead of writing full trajectory
files;

capture detection from the first post-scatter negative-energy state;

compact final evaporation-time output for complete valid unbinding events;

optional richer survival diagnostics behind explicit diagnostic paths;

MPI-aware snapshot output for long parameter-point jobs;

safeguards for pathological trajectories and low-capture-rate runs;

server-friendly local configuration conventions, with generated binaries,
job scripts, and run configs kept outside version control under bin/.

Build And Deployment
Dependencies
CMake 3.12 or newer and Git

C++14-capable compiler

OpenMPI or MPICH, including development headers

Boost 1.65 or newer

libconfig++ development headers and library

Python 3 only when building/running the full test suite

On Ubuntu/Debian, install the native prerequisites with:

bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake git libboost-dev libconfig++-dev libopenmpi-dev openmpi-bin python3
On macOS with Homebrew:

bash
brew install cmake boost libconfig open-mpi
The first CMake configure downloads obscura v1.0.1 and libphysica v0.1.2
under the build tree's _deps/ directory. Their exact Git commits are pinned by the root CMake project.
GoogleTest is fetched only when BUILD_TESTING=ON. Internet access is therefore
needed on the first configure unless those FetchContent source directories have
already been populated.

Local Build
bash
cmake -S . -B build \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$PWD/install" \
  -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF \
  -DCODE_COVERAGE=OFF
cmake --build build --config Release --parallel
cmake --install build --config Release
This produces a self-contained project install layout (apart from the native
MPI and libconfig++ shared libraries):

text
install/
├── bin/DaMaSCUS-SUN
└── share/DaMaSCUS-SUN/
    ├── model_agss09.dat
    └── examples/quickstart.cfg
Verify the fresh install with the tracked, intentionally tiny configuration:

bash
mpirun -np 1 ./install/bin/DaMaSCUS-SUN \
  ./install/share/DaMaSCUS-SUN/examples/quickstart.cfg
The installed program locates model_agss09.dat relative to its own executable,
not relative to the checkout or the current working directory. The complete
install/ directory can therefore be moved to another location on the same
machine. Do not copy only the executable; copy the whole install prefix.

Native binaries still use the MPI and libconfig++ libraries from the build
machine. When moving to a machine with a different OS, CPU architecture, MPI
implementation, or module stack, rebuild there. On module-based clusters, load
the same compiler/MPI/libconfig modules for both build and execution.

Cluster Deployment
A typical cluster checkout follows the same pattern:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Funyday-k/DaMaSCUS-SUN-EVAP.git
cd DaMaSCUS-SUN-EVAP
cmake -S . -B build \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$PWD/install" \
  -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF \
  -DCODE_COVERAGE=OFF
cmake --build build --config Release --parallel
cmake --install build --config Release
Keep machine-specific configuration, batch scripts, and scheduler output outside
the install prefix (the repository's ignored bin/ directory is one option).

Run a parameter point with MPI:

bash
mpirun -np 8 ./install/bin/DaMaSCUS-SUN /absolute/path/to/config.cfg
For a scheduler, wrap the same executable/config pair in the local batch script
used by that machine.

If a nonstandard packaging layout stores the solar table elsewhere, set either
an exact file or its containing directory:

bash
export DAMASCUS_SUN_SOLAR_MODEL=/absolute/path/model_agss09.dat
# or: export DAMASCUS_SUN_DATA_DIR=/absolute/path/to/data
To build and run the test suite, configure separately with
-DBUILD_TESTING=ON, build, then run ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure.

The radial residence domain is a compile-time setting because its bin count is
part of the fixed histogram layout. Keep alternate cutoffs in separate build
directories and provide both the cutoff and the matching number of exterior
shells. The default is 1 AU with 423 exterior bins. For example, a
5.2-AU comparison build uses:

bash
cmake -S . -B build-5p2au \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF \
  -DDAMASCUS_RADIAL_DOMAIN_MAX_AU=5.2 \
  -DDAMASCUS_EXTERIOR_BINS=527
cmake --build build-5p2au --target DaMaSCUS-SUN --parallel
Grid initialization rejects a mismatched bin count when the generated shells
either stop short of the chosen domain or reach it before the final bin.

Configuration
Configuration files use libconfig syntax. The most important controls are:

Setting	Meaning
run_mode	"Parameter point" for the main evaporation workflow, "Capture" for capture-rate runs, or "Parameter scan" for detector-limit scans.
sample_size	In normal mode, the exact target number of complete, valid evaporation events whose bound exterior orbit stays within the default 1-AU radial domain. Captures physically removed at 1 AU contribute residence statistics but not the evaporation-event target. Invalid captures are replaced. In capture mode, this is the exact target number of captures.
fixed_seed	Optional non-negative PRNG seed. 0 or an omitted setting uses nondeterministic seeding; a nonzero value is expanded independently by MPI rank.
max_trajectories	Optional hard cap on generated trajectories. 0 or unset means no trajectory-count cap.
interpolation_points	Scattering-rate interpolation grid size. 0 disables interpolation; production runs should compare representative values before fixing this.
output_dir	Root directory for generated result folders; a trailing / is optional. A relative path is resolved from the process working directory, so production batch jobs should normally use an absolute path.
DM_mass	Dark matter mass in GeV.
DM_cross_section_nucleon	DM-nucleon cross section in cm^2.
DM_cross_section_electron	DM-electron cross section in cm^2 where relevant.
maximum_number_of_scatterings	Per-trajectory computational cutoff. Cutoff-terminated captures are not treated as clean physical evaporation events.
snapshot_enabled	Enables intermediate wall-clock progress reports for parameter-point runs. Disabled automatically in capture mode.
snapshot_interval	Positive integer wall-clock spacing, in seconds, for snapshot reports. Defaults to 60 seconds when snapshots are enabled.
max_trajectory_wall_time_sec	Optional per-trajectory wall-time guard. Snapshot recorder overhead is excluded from this budget.
MPI trajectory scheduling uses a dynamic RMA work queue. Every rank claims one
trajectory at a time and releases its slot immediately on completion, so fast
ranks continue working without waiting at a per-batch collective for the
slowest trajectory. The queue maintains
accepted_samples + in_flight <= sample_size; therefore the final exact-target
tail may temporarily leave excess ranks idle, but
capture_target_overshoot remains zero. Output headers report
mpi_scheduler_work_claims and mpi_scheduler_peak_in_flight.

For reproducible MPI runs, a nonzero fixed seed is expanded by rank as
base_seed + 1000003 * mpi_rank. Computational cutoffs are tracked separately
from physical right-censoring so that final evaporation-time files contain only
complete valid unbinding events. Numerical failures and computational
truncations are recorded and replaced; their accumulated fraction does not
stop the work queue. Use max_trajectories when an explicit attempt budget is
required.

A trajectory can become physically bound only at a scattering. If an
uncaptured trajectory acquires negative energy during scatter-free propagation,
the run classifies that trajectory as a numerical failure instead of allowing
repeated bound Kepler returns to stall its MPI batch.

Outputs
For non-capture parameter-point runs, the final files are written after MPI
reduction:

bincount.txt: capture-conditioned residence-time and v^2 dt radial
histograms with error estimates. The radial grid is body-dependent at runtime:
for a Sun run it is uniform at 0.001 R_sun through 1.1 R_sun, and for an
Earth run it is uniform at 0.001 R_body through 1.1 R_body. From there,
shell widths start continuously at the inner bin width and grow geometrically
by 2% per shell toward a global width cap. The default 1-AU domain ends before
that cap is reached and uses 423 exterior shells. Radial columns are reported
as r_lower_Rbody and r_upper_Rbody. Negative-energy
exterior Kepler arcs contribute exact shell integrals. A captured orbit whose
apoapsis exceeds 1 AU is propagated analytically to its outward 1-AU
crossing, marked outer_domain_removal, and contributes capture plus
residence statistics through that crossing. It does not contribute an
evaporation-time event. Captured trajectories stopped by a wall-time guard
retain their accepted residence prefix, are counted as computationally
censored, and are replaced by a new trajectory without entering the invalid
fraction or the evaporation-time table. Step- and scattering-count guards
also retain their accepted residence prefix but remain computational
truncations. Numerical failures are excluded from residence statistics.
Accepted numerical RK
intervals are conservatively split using
adaptive Hermite dense output. Uncaptured residence histograms are not
written because capture membership gates every residence contribution.

evaporation_times.txt: compact complete-event table with
rank trajectory_id lifetime_unbinding_sec r_capture_Rbody E_capture_eV dE_capture_eV, followed by the number of negative-energy exterior arcs,
the first/last/maximum osculating Kepler periods at outward 1.1 R_body
crossings, and the corresponding first/last/maximum analytic exterior
return times. It is sorted by
lifetime_unbinding_sec with rank trajectory_id tie-breakers.

residence_jackknife_blocks.tsv: exactly 64 deterministic blocks assigned by
splitmix64(base_seed, rank, trajectory_id) % 64. Each block contains
attempted, captured, completed uncaptured escape, accepted residence,
invalid, and outer-domain-removal counts plus its full radial dt and
v^2 dt histograms. The writer refuses to publish the file unless every
scalar count and every radial bin closes against bincount.txt. It is the
required input for delete-one-block propagation of capture-rate/residence
covariance into shell and channel flux uncertainties.

invalid_trajectories.tsv: always-on, replayable ledger for trajectories
excluded by numerical or computational validity rules. It is header-only
when no invalid trajectory occurred. Each row records the failure stage,
exact termination reason and numerical-failure detail, boundary/reference
energy diagnostics, capture/survival state, final kinematics, shifted initial
condition, and the std::mt19937 states before initial-condition generation
and before trajectory simulation.

Replay one ledger row with the installed helper:

bash
replay-invalid-trajectory CONFIG.cfg invalid_trajectories.tsv RANK TRAJECTORY_ID
The helper restores the recorded pre-simulation RNG state and shifted initial
condition, reruns the current trajectory implementation, and prints the
original/replayed reason, failure detail, final state, and diagnostic-event
count. It reads only the current ledger schema; old ledger compatibility is not
provided.

The terminal summary and bincount.txt header report captured and uncaptured
counts for every TrajectoryTerminationReason and every concrete numerical
failure detail. This breakdown is always available; it is not gated by
trajectory_summary_enabled.

Optional trajectory diagnostics are enabled with trajectory_summary_enabled = true.
This adds run_metadata.json, trajectory_summary.tsv, and
trajectory_events.tsv without changing the capture or evaporation state
definitions. Set trajectory_events_enabled = true and
trajectory_trace_rate in [0, 1] to select lifecycle traces by a stable hash;
set trajectory_trace_seed to keep that selection identical across runs. The
selection does not consume the physics RNG. Traced trajectories include the
complete pre-initial-condition std::mt19937 state and shifted initial
condition, plus real-time scatter, state-transition, solar-crossing, escape,
censoring, and numerical-failure events.

The bound-exit period is the point-mass osculating Kepler period inferred from
the negative-energy state at the outward 1.1 R_body matching surface. The
exterior elapsed time is the physically used analytic travel time: through
apoapsis to the inbound matching surface for contained arcs, or one-way to the
outward 1-AU removal point for outer-domain arcs. These are kept separate
because the osculating full period includes a point-mass continuation through
the body interior, whereas the simulation uses the extended body potential
there.

The bincount.txt and snapshot report headers expose both capture_rate_raw
(captured / all attempted) and capture_rate_valid (captured / physically
classified), with separate standard errors and Wilson intervals.

When snapshots are enabled, intermediate files are written under snapshot/:

snapshot_{time}s.txt: cumulative progress report at the snapshot wall time.
Its commented [MPI rank status] table reports each rank's activity, local
trajectory ID, trajectory wall time, simulated elapsed time, scattering
count, and the rank-local observation time. An in-progress trajectory that
has already captured contributes its accumulated residence prefix
provisionally. If its bound exterior arc crosses the 1-AU removal surface,
the forced publication includes the one-way residence integral through that
crossing. Status rows remain comments so data readers see only bincount bins.

snapshot_{time}s_evaporation_times.txt: complete valid evaporation events
first published by that checkpoint, sorted by lifetime_unbinding_sec.
An event committed concurrently with a snapshot boundary is assigned once to
the next checkpoint rather than being dropped.

Snapshot files are progress diagnostics. They do not replace the final
post-reduction bincount.txt and evaporation_times.txt products, and they are
not restart checkpoints. A report can temporarily have snapshot_status = partial while ranks publish their state. If a rank misses the deadline, the
report remains incomplete rather than reconstructing state that was not
captured. Final rank states are retained when the last merge is incomplete.
Snapshot reports likewise expose attempted, classified, unresolved, and
numerical_failures counts plus raw and valid capture-rate intervals. The
uncaptured-bound free-flight guard records its failures in these cumulative
reports without printing one warning for every failed trajectory.

The executable requests MPI_THREAD_FUNNELED; only the main thread calls MPI,
while one heartbeat thread per rank performs local state copies and file I/O.
Concurrent jobs must use distinct output directories.

Snapshot checkpoint I/O is supported on homogeneous POSIX (Linux/macOS) MPI
nodes sharing the output filesystem. The binary checkpoint representation is
local to a run and is not a portable interchange or restart format.

Capture-mode runs skip the full output path and print the capture summary
instead.

Physics Validation
The ordinary test suite now includes a physics-validation gate for analytic
Kepler convergence, body-profile structure, incident impact-parameter
sampling, scattering-angle sampling, and the Maxwell thermal-speed limit:

bash
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -L physics-validation
The runtime body-dependent radial grid refactor is additionally covered by
regression tests for Hermite runtime binning, Kepler exterior arc runtime
binning, snapshot runtime histogram lengths, runtime-size merge, and Earth
final-output schema.

Production results should additionally pass the slower grid-and-seed
convergence matrix described in
validation/README.md. It compares direct scattering
rates with interpolated grids using capture-rate confidence intervals, average
scattering counts, radial distributions, evaporation-time statistics, and the
numerical-failure fraction.
